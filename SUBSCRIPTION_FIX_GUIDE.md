# üîß Subscription Not Working - Complete Fix Guide

## Problem
After subscribing, users are redirected back to the pricing page instead of accessing the dashboard. The subscription is not being saved to the database.

## Root Cause
The webhook from Dodo Payments is either:
1. Not receiving payment events
2. Not saving to the Supabase database
3. Missing environment variables in Vercel

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Check Vercel Environment Variables

**CRITICAL**: Make sure ALL these variables are set in Vercel:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

2. Verify these variables exist for **Production** environment:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://mxjbsxnmrlptfqgtbbmb.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJI...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=sbp_46129c069d09...
DODO_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_ko62zyrTkt...
DODO_BEARER_TOKEN=0UnngA9-GRgdCdRJ...
NEXT_PUBLIC_DODO_PRODUCT_MONTHLY=pdt_3c1A6P4Cpe8KhGYnJNiCN
NEXT_PUBLIC_DODO_PRODUCT_YEARLY=pdt_SZ87OdK4dC9a9tpHTIUJZ
```

3. **IMPORTANT**: After adding/updating any variable, you MUST **Redeploy** the app:
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Click latest deployment ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Redeploy

---

### Step 2: Verify Dodo Webhook Configuration

1. Go to: https://dodo.link/dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Webhooks

2. Make sure webhook endpoint is set to:
   ```
   https://app.orgatreeker.com/api/webhooks/dodo
   ```

3. Make sure these events are enabled:
   - ‚úÖ payment.succeeded
   - ‚úÖ payment.failed
   - ‚úÖ subscription.active
   - ‚úÖ subscription.renewed
   - ‚úÖ subscription.cancelled
   - ‚úÖ subscription.expired

4. Test the webhook:
   - Click "Send Test Event"
   - Select "payment.succeeded"
   - Click Send
   - **Expected result**: Status 200 OK

---

### Step 3: Check Supabase RLS Policies

The subscriptions table needs proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mxjbsxnmrlptfqgtbbmb/auth/policies

2. For the `subscriptions` table, you need these policies:

**Policy 1: Allow service role to insert/update**
```sql
-- This is for webhook writes (using service role key)
CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage subscriptions"
ON subscriptions
FOR ALL
TO service_role
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);
```

**Policy 2: Allow users to read their own subscription**
```sql
-- This is for users reading their own subscription
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own subscription"
ON subscriptions
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (clerk_user_id = auth.jwt() ->> 'sub');
```

**To add these policies**:
- Go to Supabase ‚Üí SQL Editor
- Run the SQL commands above
- Click "Run"

---

### Step 4: Test Subscription Flow Manually

Let's test if the webhook can save subscriptions:

1. **Test webhook locally first**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Use this test script** (create test-webhook-manual.js):
   ```javascript
   const testWebhook = async () => {
     const payload = {
       type: 'payment.succeeded',
       event_id: 'test_' + Date.now(),
       data: {
         customer: {
           email: 'YOUR_TEST_EMAIL@gmail.com'  // ‚Üê Use your actual email
         },
         product_id: 'pdt_3c1A6P4Cpe8KhGYnJNiCN',
         payment_id: 'test_payment_123',
         subscription_id: 'test_sub_123'
       }
     };

     console.log('Sending test webhook...');
     const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/dodo', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
       body: JSON.stringify(payload)
     });

     console.log('Response:', response.status);
     console.log('Body:', await response.json());
   };

   testWebhook();
   ```

3. Run the test:
   ```bash
   node test-webhook-manual.js
   ```

4. Check if subscription was saved:
   - Go to Supabase ‚Üí Table Editor ‚Üí subscriptions
   - Look for your email

---

### Step 5: Manual Subscription Activation (Temporary Workaround)

If the webhook is still not working, you can manually activate a subscription:

1. Go to Supabase ‚Üí SQL Editor

2. Run this query (replace with your Clerk user ID and email):
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO subscriptions (
     clerk_user_id,
     email,
     status,
     plan,
     subscription_id,
     product_id
   ) VALUES (
     'user_xxxxxxxxxxxxx',  -- ‚Üê Your Clerk user ID
     'your-email@gmail.com',  -- ‚Üê Your email
     'active',
     'monthly',
     'manual_activation',
     'pdt_3c1A6P4Cpe8KhGYnJNiCN'
   )
   ON CONFLICT (clerk_user_id)
   DO UPDATE SET
     status = 'active',
     plan = 'monthly',
     updated_at = now();
   ```

3. To find your Clerk user ID:
   - Go to https://dashboard.clerk.com ‚Üí Users
   - Click on your user
   - Copy the User ID (starts with `user_`)

---

### Step 6: Check Webhook Logs

**In Vercel**:
1. Go to your project ‚Üí Logs
2. Filter by: `/api/webhooks/dodo`
3. Look for errors like:
   - "Webhook signature verification failed"
   - "Error upserting subscription"
   - "Supabase client is null"

**In Dodo Dashboard**:
1. Go to Webhooks ‚Üí Logs
2. Check recent webhook deliveries
3. Look for failed attempts or error responses

## üß™ Testing Checklist

After making changes, verify:

- [ ] All environment variables are in Vercel (Production)
- [ ] App has been redeployed after env var changes
- [ ] Dodo webhook endpoint is correct: `https://app.orgatreeker.com/api/webhooks/dodo`
- [ ] Dodo webhook secret matches `DODO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel
- [ ] Webhook test from Dodo returns 200 OK
- [ ] Supabase RLS policies allow service role to write to subscriptions table
- [ ] `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set in Vercel
- [ ] Manual subscription insert works in Supabase
- [ ] After manual insert, you can access the dashboard

---

## üéØ Expected Flow

When everything is working:

1. User clicks "Subscribe" on pricing page
2. User completes payment on Dodo checkout
3. Dodo sends webhook to your endpoint
4. Webhook verifies signature ‚úÖ
5. Webhook saves subscription to Supabase ‚úÖ
6. User redirected to `/success` page
7. Success page checks database ‚Üí finds subscription ‚úÖ
8. User redirected to `/` (dashboard)
9. Middleware checks database ‚Üí finds subscription ‚úÖ
10. User sees dashboard with full app access ‚úÖ

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

1. **Forgetting to redeploy after changing env vars** - Changes only apply after redeploy!
2. **Wrong webhook secret** - Must match exactly between Dodo and Vercel
3. **Missing SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY** - Webhook can't write without it
4. **RLS blocking writes** - Need service role policy on subscriptions table
5. **Wrong webhook URL** - Must be production URL, not localhost

---

## üìû Still Not Working?

If you've tried everything above:

1. **Enable debug logging**: The webhook already has extensive logging
2. **Check Vercel Function Logs**: Real-time logs show exactly what's happening
3. **Test webhook manually**: Use the test script above to isolate the issue
4. **Use manual activation**: Temporarily activate subscription while debugging
5. **Contact Dodo Support**: They can see webhook delivery attempts on their end

---

## üöÄ Quick Fix Summary

Most common issue: **Environment variables not in Vercel**

Quick fix:
1. Copy ALL variables from `.env.local` to Vercel (Production)
2. Redeploy the app
3. Test webhook from Dodo dashboard
4. If still not working, manually activate subscription (see Step 5)

---

## üìù Notes

- The app checks database FIRST, then Clerk metadata as fallback
- Middleware protects routes and redirects non-subscribers to `/pricing`
- `/success` page verifies subscription before redirecting to dashboard
- Webhook uses `supabaseAdmin` (service role) to bypass RLS
