# Subscription Flow - Complete Implementation âœ…

## Overview
This document describes the complete subscription flow that has been implemented to ensure users must subscribe before accessing the app.

## User Flow

### 1. **Sign Up / Sign In**
- User signs up or signs in through Clerk
- After successful authentication, users are **automatically redirected to `/pricing`** (not the dashboard)
- This is configured in `app/layout.tsx` with `afterSignInUrl="/pricing"` and `afterSignUpUrl="/pricing"`

### 2. **Pricing Page**
- User sees the pricing page with subscription options (monthly/yearly)
- The pricing page checks if the user already has an active subscription
- If subscribed, user is automatically redirected to the dashboard
- If not subscribed, user must choose a plan and proceed to checkout

### 3. **Checkout & Payment**
- User clicks on a plan (monthly or yearly)
- Checkout session is created via `/api/checkout`
- User is redirected to Dodo Payments checkout page
- User completes payment

### 4. **Post-Payment Webhook** (Automatic)
- Dodo Payments sends a webhook to `/api/webhooks/dodo`
- Webhook handler (`app/api/webhooks/dodo/route.ts`):
  - Verifies webhook signature for security
  - Updates **BOTH** Clerk metadata and database
  - Saves subscription data to `subscriptions` table in Supabase
  - Updates user's publicMetadata in Clerk for backward compatibility
- This happens automatically in the background (within 1-2 seconds)

### 5. **Success Page**
- After payment, user is redirected to `/success` page
- Success page:
  - Checks database first (most reliable)
  - Falls back to Clerk metadata if database check fails
  - Shows success message with loading indicator
  - Redirects to dashboard after **1.5-2 seconds** (no more 30-second wait!)
- User is then taken to the app dashboard

### 6. **Access Control (Middleware)**
- Every protected route goes through `middleware.ts`
- Middleware checks subscription status:
  1. **Priority 1:** Database check (primary source of truth)
  2. **Priority 2:** Clerk metadata (fallback for compatibility)
- If no active subscription, user is redirected to `/pricing`
- If subscription is active, user can access the app

## Key Implementation Details

### Database-First Approach
- The subscription status is **primarily stored in Supabase database** (`subscriptions` table)
- This is the most reliable source of truth
- Clerk metadata is only used as a fallback

### File Changes Made

#### 1. `app/layout.tsx`
```typescript
// Changed redirect URLs from "/" to "/pricing"
<ClerkProvider
  afterSignInUrl="/pricing"  // âœ… Now redirects to pricing
  afterSignUpUrl="/pricing"   // âœ… Now redirects to pricing
  signInUrl="/sign-in"
  signUpUrl="/sign-up"
>
```

#### 2. `middleware.ts`
```typescript
// Priority 1: Check database (primary source of truth)
const hasSubscription = await hasActiveSubscription(userId);

if (hasSubscription) {
  return NextResponse.next(); // Allow access
}

// Priority 2: Fall back to Clerk metadata
const user = await currentUser();
const subscription = user?.publicMetadata?.subscription as any;
const hasActiveFromClerk = subscription?.status === 'active' || subscription?.status === 'trialing';

if (!hasActiveFromClerk) {
  // Redirect to pricing
  const pricingUrl = new URL('/pricing', request.url);
  return NextResponse.redirect(pricingUrl);
}
```

#### 3. `app/success/page.tsx`
- Removed the 30-second polling loop
- Now checks once and redirects after 1.5-2 seconds
- Checks database first, then Clerk metadata
- Much faster and better UX

#### 4. `app/pricing/page.tsx`
- Added database check for subscription status
- If user already has subscription, redirects to dashboard
- If not, shows pricing page

### Database Schema

The `subscriptions` table structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  clerk_user_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'active', 'inactive', 'trialing', 'cancelled', 'failed', 'expired'
  plan TEXT,  -- 'monthly' or 'yearly'
  subscription_id TEXT,
  product_id TEXT,
  payment_id TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  last_event_type TEXT,
  last_event_id TEXT
);
```

## Summary

âœ… **Users must subscribe before accessing app**  
âœ… **Database is primary source of truth**  
âœ… **Fast redirect (1.5-2 seconds) after subscription**  
âœ… **Seamless experience for returning users**  
âœ… **Secure webhook handling with signature verification**  
âœ… **Comprehensive middleware protection**

The flow is now complete and production-ready! ðŸš€
