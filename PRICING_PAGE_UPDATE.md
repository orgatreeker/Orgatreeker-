## Expected Results

### Conversion Rate Improvements

- Monthly: 12% (intentionally lower)
- Yearly: 45% (target - heavily promoted)
- Yearly/Monthly ratio: 3.75:1

### Revenue Impact

If 100 visitors:
- **Before**: 15 monthly + 25 yearly = 40 conversions
  - Revenue: (15 √ó $8 √ó 12) + (25 √ó $49) = $1,440 + $1,225 = **$2,665/year**

- **After**: 12 monthly + 45 yearly = 57 conversions
  - Revenue: (12 √ó $8 √ó 12) + (45 √ó $49) = $1,152 + $2,205 = **$3,357/year**
  - **+26% increase in revenue!**

Plus enterprise upsells from contact form.

## Testing Recommendations

2. Discount messaging ($47 saved vs 49% off)

4. Social proof numbers (try different metrics)
5. CTA copy variations

### Metrics to Track
