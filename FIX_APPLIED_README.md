# ‚úÖ Subscription System Fixed!

## What Was Wrong

Your Supabase backend couldn't read or write subscription data because:

1. ‚ùå **RLS Policies Were Blocking Access** - Fixed! ‚úÖ
2. ‚ùå **Wrong Service Role Key Format** - Needs your action ‚ö†Ô∏è

## What I Fixed

‚úÖ **Fixed RLS Policies**
- Service role can now write subscription data
- Database is ready to accept webhook updates
- Applied 2 migrations to fix permissions

‚úÖ **Updated Environment Files**
- Added clear comments about the service role key issue
- Marked the lines that need to be updated

‚úÖ **Created Documentation**
- `GET_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY.md` - How to get the correct key
- `SUBSCRIPTION_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Technical details
- `scripts/test-subscription-write.ts` - Test script

## What You Need To Do (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Get Your Correct Service Role Key

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mxjbsxnmrlptfqgtbbmb/settings/api
2. Find the **"service_role"** key (NOT the anon key)
3. Copy the entire key (it's very long and starts with `eyJ...`)

### Step 2: Update Your Environment Variables

**A. Local Development (`.env.local`):**
```bash
# Line 18 - Replace this:
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=sbp_46129c069d0946a4c28b8f150da341d5f4536c0f

# With the key from Supabase Dashboard:
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im14amJzeG5tcmxwdGZxZ3RiYm1iIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDk3MjUxNSwiZXhwIjoyMDc2NTQ4NTE1fQ.YOUR_ACTUAL_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_HERE
```

**B. Production (`.env.production`):**
- Update line 27 with the same key

**C. Vercel (Production):**
1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Environment Variables section
3. Find `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
4. Update with the new key
5. **Important:** Click "Redeploy" after updating

### Step 3: Test Everything

```bash
# Install test dependency
npm install -D tsx

# Run the test script
npx tsx scripts/test-subscription-write.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üß™ Testing Supabase Subscription Write Access...

1Ô∏è‚É£ Checking service role key...
‚úÖ Service role key format looks correct

2Ô∏è‚É£ Testing subscription write...
‚úÖ Successfully wrote test subscription

3Ô∏è‚É£ Testing subscription read...
‚úÖ Successfully read subscription

4Ô∏è‚É£ Testing subscription status check...
‚úÖ Subscription correctly detected as active

5Ô∏è‚É£ Cleaning up test data...
‚úÖ Test data cleaned up

üéâ All tests passed!
```

## Testing the Full Payment Flow

After updating the key and passing the test:

1. **Sign up** for a new account (or use existing)
2. Go to **/pricing** page
3. Click a plan and complete **test payment**
4. Check that you're **redirected to dashboard** ‚úÖ
5. Verify you can access the app ‚úÖ

## Troubleshooting

### If the test script fails:

**"Service role key has wrong format"**
- Make sure the key starts with `eyJ`
- Make sure you copied the **service_role** key, not anon
- Check there are no extra spaces or newlines

**"Failed to write subscription"**
- Restart your dev server after updating .env.local
- Check the key is correctly set in the file
- View detailed errors in Supabase logs

**"Failed to read subscription back"**
- Check RLS policies in Supabase dashboard
- Make sure migrations were applied (they were)

### Still having issues?

1. **Check Supabase Logs**:
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mxjbsxnmrlptfqgtbbmb/logs/postgres-logs

2. **Check Vercel Logs** (for production):
   Your Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Logs tab

3. **Verify the key format**:
   ```bash
   # The key should be a JWT token
   # You can decode it at https://jwt.io to verify it shows role: "service_role"
   ```

## What Happens Now

With the correct service role key:

```
‚úÖ User pays ‚Üí Dodo Payments receives payment
‚úÖ Dodo sends webhook ‚Üí Your webhook endpoint receives it
‚úÖ Webhook verifies signature ‚Üí Security check passes
