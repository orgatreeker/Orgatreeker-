## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Webhook Not Firing

**Symptoms:**
- Payment succeeds
- User redirected to success page
- But subscription doesn't activate

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Webhook URL in Dodo Dashboard**
   - Go to Dodo Payments Dashboard
   - Settings ‚Üí Webhooks
   - Verify URL is: `https://app.orgatreeker.com/api/webhooks/dodo`
   - Make sure it's enabled/active

2. **Check Webhook Secret**
   - In Dodo Dashboard, copy the webhook secret
   - Compare with Vercel environment variable
   - They must match exactly

3. **Check Vercel Logs**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Functions
   - Look for error messages
   - Check if webhook endpoint is being called

4. **Verify Domain is Public**
   - Test if `https://app.orgatreeker.com/api/webhooks/dodo` is accessible
   - It should return 200 OK (even if just for GET requests)

### Issue: "Invalid Signature" Error

**Solution:**
```
DODO_WEBHOOK_SECRET in Vercel ‚â† Secret in Dodo Dashboard
```

1. Go to Dodo Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Copy the webhook secret
3. Go to Vercel ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. Update `DODO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to match exactly
5. Redeploy if needed

### Issue: Redirect Goes to Localhost

**Solution:**
This should already be fixed in the latest code. The checkout API now uses:
```typescript
return_url: "https://app.orgatreeker.com/success"
```

If it's still happening:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify latest code is deployed
3. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
