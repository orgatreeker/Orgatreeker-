# Apply Budget Route - Setup Complete âœ…

## What Was Fixed

The `/api/apply-budget` route has been updated to properly save budget preferences to Supabase.

### Changes Made:

1. **Route Updated** (`app/api/apply-budget/route.ts`)
   - âœ… Clerk authentication added
   - âœ… Supabase integration restored
   - âœ… Validates budget percentages (must sum to 100)
   - âœ… Saves preferences to `user_settings` table
   - âœ… Creates or updates existing settings

2. **Database Schema Extension** (`supabase-migration-budget-preferences.sql`)
   - Adds columns to store budget percentages
   - Adds validation constraints
   - Adds documentation comments

## ðŸ”§ Required: Run Database Migration

You need to run the migration to add the new columns to your database.

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor

Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mxjbsxnmrlptfqgtbbmb/sql

Or navigate:
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select project: `mxjbsxnmrlptfqgtbbmb`
3. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Run the Migration

1. Click **New Query** button
2. Copy the contents of `supabase-migration-budget-preferences.sql`
3. Paste into the SQL Editor
4. Click **Run** or press `Ctrl+Enter`

### Expected Output:
```
Success. No rows returned
```

This adds 4 new columns to `user_settings`:
- `needs_percentage` (INTEGER)
- `wants_percentage` (INTEGER)
- `savings_percentage` (INTEGER)
- `applied_at` (TIMESTAMP)

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User goes through **Budget Onboarding** (`/budget-onboarding`)
2. Provides financial information (income, expenses, debt, location, goals)
3. AI generates personalized budget split (e.g., 60% needs, 25% wants, 15% savings)
4. User clicks **"Apply This Budget"**
5. POST request sent to `/api/apply-budget` with percentages
6. **Route saves preferences** to `user_settings` table
7. Redirects to dashboard (`/app`)

### API Endpoint:

**POST** `/api/apply-budget`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "needs": 50,
  "wants": 30,
  "savings": 20
}
```

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Budget preferences saved successfully",
  "preferences": {
    "needs_percentage": 50,
    "wants_percentage": 30,
    "savings_percentage": 20,
    "applied_at": "2025-01-21T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `401 Unauthorized` - User not signed in
- `400 Bad Request` - Missing percentages or percentages don't sum to 100
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Database error

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test the Route:

1. **Restart dev server** (the route was updated):
   - Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   - Run: `npm run dev`

2. **Test the onboarding flow**:
   - Go to: http://localhost:3001/budget-onboarding
   - Complete all steps
   - Click "Apply This Budget"
   - Should redirect to dashboard with preferences saved

3. **Verify in Supabase**:
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mxjbsxnmrlptfqgtbbmb/editor
   - Open `user_settings` table
   - Find your user's row (by `clerk_user_id`)
   - Verify the percentage columns are populated

---

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- Uses **Clerk authentication** - only authenticated users can save preferences
- Uses **Supabase Service Role Key** for server-side operations
- Service role key is stored in `.env.local` (not committed to Git)
- RLS policies on `user_settings` ensure users can only access their own data

---

## ðŸ“Š Database Schema

The `user_settings` table now stores:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_settings (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  clerk_user_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  currency_code TEXT DEFAULT 'USD',
  currency_symbol TEXT DEFAULT '$',
  currency_name TEXT DEFAULT 'US Dollar',
  theme TEXT DEFAULT 'light',
  needs_percentage INTEGER,      -- NEW
  wants_percentage INTEGER,      -- NEW
  savings_percentage INTEGER,    -- NEW
  applied_at TIMESTAMP,          -- NEW
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Use percentages to auto-generate budget categories
- Display budget split on dashboard
- Compare actual spending to recommended percentages
- Allow users to adjust percentages later in settings
- Historical tracking of budget preference changes

## âœ… Checklist

Before using the feature:

- [x] Route updated with Supabase integration
- [x] Service role key added to `.env.local`
- [ ] Database migration run in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Dev server restarted
- [ ] Tested onboarding flow end-to-end

## ðŸ“ž Troubleshooting

### Error: "Failed to apply budget"

**Check:**
1. Service role key is correct in `.env.local`
2. Migration has been run (columns exist)
3. User is authenticated (signed in with Clerk)
4. Check browser console for detailed error
5. Check terminal/server logs for backend errors

### Migration Fails

**Error:** "column already exists"
- Safe to ignore - columns were already added

**Error:** "permission denied"
- Ensure you're using your project's SQL Editor
- Check you're logged in to correct Supabase account

### Percentages Not Saving

1. Open browser DevTools â†’ Network tab
2. Click "Apply This Budget"
3. Find `/api/apply-budget` request
4. Check response for errors
5. Verify migration ran successfully

## ðŸŽ‰ Next Steps

Once setup is complete:
1. Test the complete onboarding flow
2. Verify data is saved in Supabase
3. Consider integrating budget percentages into the Budget page
4. Add UI to display/edit preferences in Settings

Enjoy your working budget application! ðŸš€
